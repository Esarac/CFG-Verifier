# CFG-VERIFIER
By Esteban Ariza, Johan Sebastian Giraldo, Mateo Valdes

This is a program written in Python to check if a given string can be produced by a given grammar in CNF using the CYK algorithm.

For more information read the [**instruccions**](https://github.com/Esarac/CFG-Verifier/blob/master/docs/README.pdf).

Note: Sometimes Windows detects the .exe file as a Trojan virus because it is unsigned. This is a false positive: the file does not contain any virus or malicious software. To execute the program, please add an exception in Windows Defender. Alternative, you can install Python and compile from the available source code.
